    " A normal distribution is the proper term for a probability bell curve. In a normal distribution the mean is zero and the\n",
    " standard deviation is 1. It has zero skew and a kurtosis of 3. Normal distributions are symmetrical, but not all symmetrical\n",

    " 1. Mean or Median Imputation. When data is missing at random, we can use list-wise or pair-wise deletion of the missing\n",

    " A/B testing, also known as split testing, refers to a randomized experimentation process wherein two or more versions of a\n",
    " variable (web page, page element, etc.) are shown to different segments of website visitors at the same time to determine\n",
    " which version leaves the maximum impact and drive business metrics.\n",
    " Essentially, A/B testing eliminates all the guesswork out of website optimization and enables experience optimizers to make\n",

    "13. Is mean imputation of missing data acceptable practice?\n",
    " True, imputing the mean preserves the mean of the observed data. So if the data are missing completely at random, the\n",

    " In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more\n",

    " simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.This term is distinct from\n",
